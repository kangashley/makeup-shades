```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Why is this here?

The data that we used for the project "Beauty Brawl" on The Pudding was fed into Javascript in a mostly-helpful way. But it could be cleaned up a bit before sharing on our public data repository. 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
shades <- read.csv("../src/assets/data/shades.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
brand_dictionary <- read.csv("../src/assets/data/brand_dictionary.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r}
cleanShades <- left_join(shades, brand_dictionary, by = c('brand' = 'brand_short', 'product' = 'foundation_short')) %>% 
  rename(brand_short = brand, brand = brand.y, product_short = product, product = foundation) %>% 
  select(c(brand, brand_short, product, product_short, hex, H, S, V, L, group))
```
