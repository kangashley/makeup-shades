What’s remarkable is that these BIPOC-created brands skew darker than everyone we’ve seen so far (including Fenty) – the densest, most consistent clustering lies in the 50-60 lightness range. Additionally, there is solid support for the darkest skin tones: every brand has at least one product within the 10-30 lightness range."}],"part1-3-pre":[{"type":"text","value":"The other interesting pattern that emerges is that BIPOC-created brands follow a different overall shape than the others.
